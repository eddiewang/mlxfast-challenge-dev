/// Whole-stacked-tensor staging for prefill-shaped expert consumption.
///
/// A long prefill touches essentially every routed expert in every layer, so
/// reading a layer's experts as ~770 individual 0.5-4.5 MB slice preads wastes
/// the SSD: each pays open/fstat/pread/close and arrives in routing order
/// rather than file order. This stager instead reads each stacked expert code
/// tensor (~1 GiB) as ONE sequential pread on a background thread, one layer
/// ahead of consumption, and the consumer builds per-expert weights from
/// no-copy Data views into the staged buffer.
///
/// Byte identity: the trusted bank's firstAxisIndex slice read returns
/// bytes[byteOffset + i*(byteLength/firstDim), +byteLength/firstDim); a
/// whole-tensor read returns [byteOffset, byteOffset+byteLength), so the CPU
/// sub-range is the same file bytes by arithmetic identity. Weights built
/// from staged views therefore feed the exact bytes — and the exact same
/// kernels — as the streamed path.
///
/// Reads go through a dedicated capacity-0 ExpertSlotBank sharing the
/// loader's metrics: no LRU is mutated (capacity-0 banks never insert, which
/// also makes them safe to use from this background thread) and every staged
/// byte is recorded honestly on the same counters the benchmark reports.
