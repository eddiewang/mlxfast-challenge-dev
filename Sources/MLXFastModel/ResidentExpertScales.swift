///
/// Two instances back the runtime:
///
/// - **Scales** (all layers, ~8 GiB): e8m0 scales are only ~6% of streamed
///   expert bytes but half of all bank round-trips — every expert
///   materialization pays a second open/fstat/pread/close for its small
///   scales slice.
/// - **Hash-layer codes** (layers routed by token id, ~9.6 GiB, only on
///   machines with the official 48 GB or more): the expert working set
///   cycles through far more bytes than any cache, and cyclic scans defeat
///   LRU — pinning converts those layers' reads into guaranteed RAM hits
///   every token instead of probabilistic page-cache hits.
///
/// Loads happen once in the (untimed) loader constructor through a dedicated
/// capacity-0 ExpertSlotBank that shares the loader's metrics: capacity 0
/// never populates an LRU (no double residency), and the whole-tensor reads
/// are recorded as honest misses/bytes on the same counters the benchmark
/// reports. Slices are Data views into the retained stacked buffer — the
/// same file bytes the bank's firstAxisIndex read would return, by the
/// bank's own slice arithmetic (byteLength / firstDimension).
// @unchecked Sendable: the single stored property (`entries`) is an immutable
// let set once in init, and reads only slice its Data, so sharing this into the
// concurrentPerform decode-prefetch workers is race-free. The annotation states
// that contract for the Swift 6 checker -- a hard error on the tenki runner's
// Swift 6.3, a warning on Blacksmith. No runtime behavior changes.
